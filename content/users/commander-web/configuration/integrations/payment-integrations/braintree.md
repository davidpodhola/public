## Set up

To set up you need following informations `Merchant Id`, `Public Key`, `Private key`, `Client Key` and names of accounts and currencies they are held in. Either request the information from Braintree and provide to MEWS or gain MEWS an admin access to Braintree.

Create an integration with Braintree and fill in `Merchant Id`, `Public Key`, `Private key`, `Client Key`. Then for each bank account specify currency and Id from Braintree. 

### Where to find data in Braintree

- Account - My User -> Api Keys to get `Merchant Id`, `Public Key`, `Private key` and `Client Key`.
- Settings -> Processing -> Merchant Accounts (bottom) to get `Merchant Account ID`s and corresponding currencies.
