- SiteMinder integration supports **Create reservations**, **Download reservations peridically**, **Upload Availability**, **Upload Prices**, **Synchronize** operations.
- SiteMinder has 2 different sets of credentials, to correct set up just provide `UserName` field with provided value:
   - `MewsSystemsAPAC` - for Australia and oceania based hotels
   - `MewsSystemsEMEA` - for Europe based hotels (not sure about America)
   - basically if one value doesn't work, the second should as there is no third option.
