####Basic Stay Settings

This section explains how to set the hotel rates and cancellation conditions, how to set up package items to rates, and how to create voucher codes.

**Basic Rate Settings** - The initial screen with rate conditions, are the conditions that apply to all rates. Most of the fields are the same in the "Services" settings with the following exceptions:

- **Reservation Max Length**: A hotel may want to set the maximum length of a reservation, so if you have a request that is longer than the max period, it will not offer availability.
- **Reservation Default Type**: Select either “Leisure” or “Business,” which will affect whether all new bookings automatically come in as Leisure or Business. After the bookings have downloaded or have been created in the system under the default stay type, you can manually change the purpose of the stay. Countries may have different city tax regulations, and this may be dependent on the reservation type.
- **Packages**: On this screen you can also add products. If you would like to package products as part of the rate, this is the screen to do so. Select "Add Product," and you will be able to create items such as breakfast, cleaning fee, city tax, halfboard, etc. The settings of these products are described in the aforementioned **Product** section.

**Rate and Vouchers**: Each standard setup of a hotel is done with a basic rate, which is considered the BAR rate, off which the other rates may or may not float. This section is split into another 2 sub-categories.

- **Rates**: An overview of all the different rates that have been set. Here you can quickly identify whether a rate is a voucher rate (only bookable with a voucher code, travel agent or company profile attached) and whether the rate is enabled.
- **Vouchers**: This is an overview of all the vouchers that have been set up. Each voucher can only be assigned to either a company or a travel agent. Also, it is important that when creating the voucher, you select the rates that you would like to apply to this voucher. (All voucher rates are displayed in the selection field). Lastly, you can create a number of voucher codes, which can be used directly in the Mews Distributor or Commander when booking a room.
