In order to create chargeable services, you will need to set up each service and its sub-services in this section. The screen is divided in 2 sections:

1. **Services**: These are general services the hotels sells, such as the minibar, transfers, food&beverage, etc. and can be posted also manually from the Guest Profile - Billing Screen. At the same time if you want to create services for the Navigator, you will need to set them up in this section.
2. **Stay Services**: This is where accommodation rates, cancellation conditions and rate management is done. This is also the section where you set up products that can be packaged with the accommodation, such as breakfast, city tax, etc.
