title: Distributor
---

The Mews Distributor can be set up and managed directly via the Mews Commander. When you access the settings of your hotel, you will see a link to the "Mews Distributor" directly from the menu. When you select the link, it will open a sample for your hotel. In order to ensure the Mews Distributor works optimally, ensure that all of the following configuration is set up:

## Languages
The Mews Distributor is available in the following languages. All buttons and main texts have been translated. However note that if you wish to use multiple languages, the hotel is responsible for completing the translations of:
- Room Names & Descriptions
- Rate Names & Descriptions
- Product Names & Descriptions

Available Languages for the Mews Distributor :
- English 
- Greek
- Czech
- Dutch
- Spanish
- French
- Danish
- German
- Korean
- Russian

## Room Types
All room types should be fully configured, this means:
- Set number of beds and extra beds correctly
- Add room type descriptions
- Add a photo for each room type
- Order E-mail Template: for some rooms, you might want to add some specific text to the standard confirmation e-mail. For example if a room type is located in another building, add some additional details. You can simply type it in this field, and we will automatically add it to the confirmation is someone books this room type.

## Rate Types
All public rates will always automatically display on the Mews Distributor, so ensure that all rates have the following fields completed:
- Rate descriptions, some examples:
 - Bad Rate Names: "Master Rate", "BAR Rate", "NR Rate", "Min 2 nts rate" --> these rates are customer un-friendly, as guests do not know abreviations and they do not know industry terminology
 - Good Rate Names: "Best Available - Flexible Rate!", "Non Refundable - Best Deal!" --> they describe the benefits of that particular rate to the customer.
- External Name field: you can use this field if you would like to set up a customer-friendly name, which is different from the "internal name" which is used in the Mews Commander. If you fill in the External Name, this is the rate name that the guest will see on the Distributor and his/her confirmation e-mail.
- If you add a city tax or service charge to the booking after the booking is made, be sure to explain this also in the rate description.

## Products
If you would like to offer the guest the option to include breakfast, or any other product (bottle of wine, flowers, etc) to their reservation, there is no need to create multiple different rates that lead to confusion. Simply create products, that the customer can select upon booking to be added to any rate selected.

Be sure to have good product descriptions, and its important that you select how the product will be charged:
- Per person per night - for example breakfast
- Per room night - for example parking 
- Once - cleaning fee for a dog

## How to embed the Distributor into your website?
In this guide, you will find a selection for "Developers", and specifically a section about the Mews Distributor. Send that link to your webdeveloper who maintains the website of you hotel. They can either implement it standardly, by simply copy posting some code, and it will follow the standard format. If you would like some customizations, we support the following customizations:
- Date preselection: if you would like to preselect arrival date, and departure dates 
- Fonts and Colors 
- Google Analytics
- Google Adword tracking
- Switch on the Rate Comparison Box
- Prefilling of voucher codes
- Preset language and currency
- Display only some of the rooms

Also in order for you to incorporate the Mews Distributor into your own website, you will need to update your website from HTTP, to HTTPS (the "S" stands for secure), so that you can take credit cards directly from your website. Your webdeveloper will know how this works.
