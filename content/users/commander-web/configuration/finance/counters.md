### Bill Number Format

- **Bill Number Format**: Should you wish to have your bills/invoices to start with a prefix number, this is the field where you can set this value. Note that Bills&Invoices (currently) share the same line of numbering. In order to set up for example a starting number 2015 in front of your bills, you have to follow it by a placeholder, to let the system know how to format it. So it would be 2015{0:0000}
- **Invoice Number Format & Proforma Number Format**: please disregard these fields, as they are only applicable for a few hotels in Czech Republic.
