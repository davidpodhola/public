## Bill Closing

You are provided with 3 options.

 - "Always Allowed" will allow you to close bills at any time, even if the items on the bill have not yet been consumed (for example a future stay).
 - "Only with Consumed Items" will allow you to only close bills that have consumed items on them, so if there is a future stay or transfer planned and pre-paid, it will not allow you to close this bill until the day of check-out. This setting is extremely restrictive to front desk, and we do not recommend using it.
 - "Only with Consumed Items in Half Day Window": this is probably the best setting to be used. Reason for this is that, the moment a bill is closed, you cannot always made changes to the booking, as items that are affected by the change are already on a closed bill. So if you do not allow bill closing until the day of departure, you ensure that you can still make changes to the booking until the day of departure.
 
## Bill Header & Bill Footer

Complete these fields with all official hotel details: address, official hotel name, VAT, bank details, etc. This will be used for Bills/Proformas/Invoices. Note that we print both Header and Footer at the top fo the bill, which is due to the design we have used, so the Footer will not be printed at the bottom of the page.
Unfortunately we cannot modify the design of the bill in any way, we have chosen this design to be valid across all hotels worldwide. When we start making exceptions it will increase the risk of bugs/misprinting, therefore we prefer to use 1 universal template.

## Invoice Due Interval

Set this field to the number of days, after which an invoice should standardly get settled. For example if you issue and invoice and it should be settled within 30 days, set it to 30. 

When the team is creating a new invoice it will in this case always select "30 days" unless you manually specify a different date.
