title: Exchange Rates
---

The Mews Commander supports multiple currencies, however rates need to be set in 1 base accounting currency. If you decide to set the exchange rate manually, you can do this in the "Exchange Rate" submenu. We recommend hotels change their exchange rate minimum 1 time yearly.

The Mews Commander works with a multi-currency environment, meaning that you can follow a different sales currency (or multiple sales currencies) that will at some point be converted to the local currency. If you regularly change the exchange rate, it will be more common that exchange rate differences occur. Mews Commander has automated the calculateion of exchange rate differences, and will post these automatically on bills, rather than relying on the Front Desk staff to post these manually.
