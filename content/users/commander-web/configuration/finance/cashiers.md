## Setting up the Cashiers

To set up the cashier for your hotel, there are 2 options:

1. The hotel may decide that all receptionists share 1 float of money. You can then assign multiple receptionists to 1 cashier in the system.
2. All receptionists may have their own float of money.  You can then only assign 1 receptionist to a cashier in the system.

To set up the cashier, select in the settings the "Cashier" button.
Once you are in the settings, you can select to create a new cashier. It will prompt you to allocate a name to the cashier, which could either be the name of the receptionist or just a generic name if you are sharing the cashier.

You can select which currencies you would like to allow the user to accept.

All of the users in the system display below the name, and you can tick the users that you would like to give access to the cashier. Once these users are ticked and saved in the system, they will immediately see a new icon on their screen allowing them to use the cashier.

Within these settings you can also tick the box "Currency Exchange.‚Äù This option will activate the currency exchange for your hotel. You can set up the currency exchange with the fair rate, with a percentage commission, or with a fixed commission.

**Note**: every user who accepts money, **MUST** be assigned to a cashier. If a user who is not assigned a cashier, accepts money, and posts this on a guest bill, the money bill not be communicated to the cashier, and you will end up with an unbalanced cashier.

## Opening your Cashier

Once your cashier is set up, it will open with a 0 Opening balance.

Usually you start your shift with a minimum opening balance, so that you have some change in your cash desk to pay back to customers who do not pay their bill with an exact amount. To set the opening balance at the beginning of the system, select "New Transaction" and post the amount of money received in the "Value Received" field with a note, describing this is the initial balance setup.
Once you have set up your initial balance correctly, you can start using the cashier, taking in money, paying out, directly from guest bills or in the cashier.

Note: if you are posting cash which is linked to revenue, you must post this on the Guest Profile Billing Screen, so that the system required firstly for revenue to be posted, which is then balanced against cash. If you post cash directly in the cashier, we will not post "revenue" against it, so its considered a simply cash exchange, which does not impact accounting report.
- Example 1: if you send a team member to a shot to buy bananas, you would do a paid out directly from the cashier, and the receipt will need to be included in the shift-drop as "cash". In this case only a payment is posted in the cashier, not impacting accounting reports.
- Example 2: if a customer pays for a minibar item in cash, you have to go to his Guest Profile, first post the minibar item, and then post the cash. So that both revenue and payment are posted.

## Closing your Cashier

- At the end of the shift, you need to count the money you have in your physical cash drawer.
- Select the "Close Shift" button in the cashier
- The system will ask you to which "base value" you would like to return the cashier once you close the shift. This value needs to be the base value of the money you would like to remain in the desk, for the next shift to start with (so for example 200 Euro in change). So if you put 200 Euro in that field, the system will calculate:
"End Value of Cashier" minus "Base Value" = "Shift Drop Amount", and it will post this amount on a report, which you need to then give to your accountant (together with the money)

Once the shift is closed, the Opening Balance will start with 200 Euro (in this example).
