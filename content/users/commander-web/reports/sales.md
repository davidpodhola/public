With the Occupancy Report, Availability and Rate Management, we have tried to make the life of a revenue manager as easy as possible, as they have a lot of data to analyse. We combine occupancy, rate, availability and competitor rates in 2 easy reports that allow the managment of inventory and rates.

We do not currently offer a pickup report, segment by segment, day by day. This is planned, but if this is critical to your operations, all of our reports export to excel, and you can build a macro that would daily import the data, to then pull together a pickup report.
