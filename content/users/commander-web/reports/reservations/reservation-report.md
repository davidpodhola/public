title: Reservation Report
---

The reservation report provides all needed information about all the bookings at the hotel. The report has a large number of filters that allows for personalization of the report. As always the report can be exported into excel, offering more columns with more detailed information.

## Filters 

Below is an explanation of a few of the key filters and their purposes.

- **Include Tax**: the report standarly runs with Net Rates, but if you would like to include tax into the rates simply tick this box and run the report.
- **Load Balances**: Should you require the overview of all guests in-house and their outstanding balances, selecting this box prior to loading will load the total bill balance of all of the guests. Note that as it will need to check all guest bills, this will slow down the running of the report somewhat.
- **Mode**: You can filter the report by "detailed" reservations. It will show each individual reservation, and you can review the individual details of these bookings. Alternatively you can select only the "Totals," and the report will only give the totals of the selection made. It will not display the individual bookings in this section.
- **Group By**:
 - Business Segment: it will run the report by the business segmentation that is set up at the hotel level.
 - Confirmation State: if you would be interested to see whether booking in the report are Optional or Confirmed.
 - Creation Date: this will show the results of the report organized by the creation date of the bookings.
 - Credit Card: to quickly show whether guest profiles have a Adyen/Braintree card attached or not, this helps identify reservations where the credit card failed, so that your reservations department can follow up on alternative payment methods.
 - Customer Category: if you would like to sort the report by Customer Category. The customer category can be set up in the Customer Profile in the "Internals" section. Should you need to add or amend the customer categories, contact your Mews representative.
 - Customer Nationality: if you want to analyse the origin of your customers.
 - Mother Company: when you set up your partner companies, you can assign also "mother companies", which represent the "head office" this helps you to quickly pull out statistics for multiple companies in 1 line.
 - Group: to pull out all the different groups that have bookings in a selected period.
 - Travel Agency: It will break the report down by all different travel agents that have booked the hotel in the selected period.
 - Partner Company: If you have assigned companies to bookings, it will break down the report by the partner companies.
 - Rate: If you would like to analyse the performance of specific rate types, you can select this filter.
 - Voucher: If you have the Mews Distributor, you can filter the report by the different voucher codes used by customers to analyse the performance of these codes.
 - Room Type: To analyse the performance of specific room types, you can see exactly how many bookings are made for each individual room type.
 - Origin: To generate a specific overview of the source of business (from booking engine, channel, and manual).
- **Filter**: You can filter the report by the following filters.
 - Created: By the creation date of the booking.
 - Arrival: By the arrival date of the booking.
 - Departure: By the departure date of the booking.
 - In House: To review all bookings in house during a specific period. Note that the "in house" overview includes 2 tables, the top-most table shows all bookings that are precisely in the interval. The second table shows all bookings that touch the interval, so if some of those bookings arrived prior to the selected or departed after, they are also included.
 - Optional: To review all optional bookings.
 - Cancelled: To review all cancelled bookings by the **stay date**
 - Cancelled on: To review all cancelled bookings by the date **on which they were cancelled**
 - Confirmed on: to review when bookings were changed from Optional to Confirmed. This filter also includes all bookings that were booked as Confirmed.

## Column Headers

Below is a description of a few of the Columns and their definitions.

- **Number**: This is the reservation number generated by the system and assigned to the booking. All guest confirmations are sent with this number, which can be searched directly in the search box.
- **Reservation Status**: This is displayed in an icon, in order to save space on the screen. The system has the following statuses:
 - Confirmed: The booking is a confirmed booking with a future arrival date.
 - Checked-in: The booking is currently in the hotel.
 - Checked-out: The booking is checked-out, and the customer is no longer in the hotel.
 - Holding: The reservation is not yet confirmed and still on optional status. When you hover over the question mark icon the release date will be displayed. Note that the system does not automatically release options. Instead, it highlights the bookings in the reservation overview/report once they have met or have passed the deadline.
- **Rate** and **Total Cost**: Note that the rate and total cost in this report are showing the rate inclusive of VAT and the products included in the rate (breakfast, city tax, halfboard, etc.).

Note that if you export the report into excel, the following additional columns are added to the report:
- Customer E-mail address
- Balance (of their bill)
- Creation date and the exact time
- Release date: if you have booked an optional booking
- Requested Room Type and Room Category: this allows you to compare whether the room type that was booked, also corresponds with the room type that was finally used to accommodate the guest.
- Reservations and Customer Notes
