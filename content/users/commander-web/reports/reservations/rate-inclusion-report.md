title: Rate Inclusion Report
---

The Rate Inclusion Overview is a chronological overview of the different package products that are included in the rate. This could be breakfast, halfboard, city tax, extra beds, etc. The report always shows the total number of customers in-house on a specific day and how many products were sold in each category.

For example, if the column "Breakfast" shows: 61/75, this means that 61 guests out of the total of 75 guests on that day have breakfast included in their rate.

This report can be used by the kitchen/restaurant to plan ahead for the amount of breakfast/lunches/dinners that are pre-booked. Alternatively housekeeping can use it to track the amount of extra beds that are booked.
