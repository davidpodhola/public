title: Activity Report

The activity report is a great tool to analyse the operations of the hotel. Its a graphical display, by day-of-week and by the hours in those days, to help analyse where you have operational busy hotspots. We track check-in/out, housekeeping and booking creation.

When you select a specific activity, you also get an overview by employee of who are the most active
s in your team.
