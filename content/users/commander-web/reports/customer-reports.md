The customer is at the heart of the Mews Commander, all bookings, orders and bills are linked to the guest profile. This setup allows us to create a number of unique and helpful customer reports, that allow you to analyse the customer data indepth to get a better understanding of patterns, and set your sales and operations strategy.

We understand that the legal requirements for registration in most countries are getting less and less over time, but we still try to improve the amount of data we collect, as it helps the hotel to improve their reporting. The online check-in helps collect fully and correctly completed guest profiles, and we currently see that 40% of guests who get invited, complete the online check-in. 

A hotel with a channel manager, generally sees an instant improvement in data, as there are no mistakes make in input of information, also data comes in, in real time.
