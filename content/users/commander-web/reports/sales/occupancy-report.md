### Room Type Overbooking

A reservations system should always prevent room type overbookings, as it leaves guests unhappy, and it does not help revenue management efforts. With faster and more modern reservations systems, room type overbookings occur less and less. However due to allotment commitments and other agreements with partners, it will happen at times that you have to accept bookings when you are already fully booked on a room type.

Only staff members with supervisory rights are allowed to make bookings from the reservations screen when a hotel is fully booked. On the new reservation screen, once you have selected your preferred dates, it will tell you on the left how many rooms in that category are still available.

Once a booking is made that exceeds the number of rooms in a room category, the system will create a "dummy room" on the timeline in red and place the booking in it. It is then up to the hotel team to move some of the bookings around to close this overbooking.
