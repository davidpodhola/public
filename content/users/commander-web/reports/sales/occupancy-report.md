### Occupancy Filter
The Occupancy Report is a schematic overview of all room types, the number of rooms in each category and the business-on-the-books for each room-type per day. The overview offers insights into Occupancy, Availability, Average Daily Rate and Rooms Booked and the sales rates.

The report opens up with net rates (exclusive of VAT and exclusive of products such as breakfast). To include the VAT, tick the value filter at the top and run the report again. The report standardly opens a 14 day period starting from today. You can run the report for any length of time. Note that the “Total” column will add up the business for the entire period, not per month.

When you export the report into Excel, it breaks down the results by result group in separate tabs allowing easy manipulation and review of the numbers.

Through the usage of colour, you are quickly able to spot busy dates, which have a darker colour or overbookings, which are highlighted in red.

Below the occupancy charge, you will also see a chart that highlights the total available rooms per category per date.

### Availability Filter

The Availability Report is a schematic overview of all room types, the number of rooms in each category, and the rooms booked on each date by room type. Similar to the occupancy report it uses colors (dark=busys & light=quiet) to higlight when you have a lot of room booked.

When you have the Mews Distributor or the Channel Manager connected, these take the availability directly from this report. So if you would like to set overbooking or block rooms from sales, this is the best location to do so. To change the number of rooms for sale on 1 specific date/room type, click on the number, and it will give you the option to block or overbook. You also have the option to amend a larger period in 1 change.

Below the room availability, you also see the BAR rate that is sold for that room type on that day. From the filters at the top of the report you can select which Rate you would ike to see. To set up the default rate (the rate with which the report always opens first), ensure that in the rate settings of each individual rate, there is an "ordering" the rate with the lowest order number will display first in the report.

If you work at a hostel, at the top of the report, you have a quick switch to quickly view "beds", "rooms" or "dorms"

### Room Type Overbooking

A reservations system should always prevent room type overbookings, as it leaves guests unhappy, and it does not help revenue management efforts. With faster and more modern reservations systems, room type overbookings occur less and less. However due to allotment commitments and other agreements with partners, it will happen at times that you have to accept bookings when you are already fully booked on a room type.

Only staff members with supervisory rights are allowed to make bookings from the reservations screen when a hotel is fully booked. On the new reservation screen, once you have selected your preferred dates, it will tell you on the left how many rooms in that category are still available.

Once a booking is made that exceeds the number of rooms in a room category, the system will create a "dummy room" on the timeline in red and place the booking in it. It is then up to the hotel team to move some of the bookings around to close this overbooking.

### Hotel Overbooking

Note: even though we have great connections with Channel Managers, it might occasionally happen that an overbooking slips through. Unforuntately as there is a few integrations that are updating each other, there are always a few minutes time difference between availablity openings/closings which might cause that, during a busy booking period 2 bookings come in at the same time, while you only had 1 room available. Unfortunately this is the risk of not managing this manually, however we see that the Channel Manager solution by far outweight not having one (time management, occupancy optiization,etc)
