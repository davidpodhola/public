title: Manager Report
---

The Manager Report is the master summary used by management to analyse the performance of the day before, month-to-date and year-to-date performances of the hotel.

The report opens up with all revenues excluding taxes. If you wish to include the taxes, tick the box "Include Tax," and run the report again.

First, it will provide an overview of the available number of rooms/beds, out of order rooms and the occupancy.
Note that if a room is placed out of order, it will deduct this from the available number of rooms in order to calculate the occupancy percentage correctly.

Secondly, it breaks down the room revenue (exclusive of products such as breakfast, halfboard, etc.). This data will be used to calculate the following sub-data:
- Room Revenue Per Available Room (REVPAR) = The total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms (total rooms minus OOO rooms).
- Room Revenue Per Available Bed (REVPAB) = The total room revenue divided by the total number of available beds (total beds minus OOO beds).
- Average Daily Rate = The total room revenue divided by the total number of occupied rooms.
- Room Revenue Per Person = The total room revenue divided by the total number of guests staying overnight.

Below the room revenue, you will also see a breakdown of the Cancellations, Refunds, other package items and all other services/accounting categories split per service with the revenue generated in that category.

Below the Total Revenues, you will also see all the Occupancy and Room Revenue numbers split per room type.

Note: if you have set up Accounting Categories, it will pull the report according to the accounting categories. If you do not have these set up, it will run according to the Services set up at the hotel.
