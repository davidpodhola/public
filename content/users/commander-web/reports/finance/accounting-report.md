The Accounting Report provides a full overview of all the revenues posted, divided by revenue group, in order to analyse the income. See below a short breakdown of all the possible filtering options:

### Modes

- Grouped: see all revenues grouped
- Detailed: see each individual revenue item as an individual item

### Type
- Billed: This filter will show all the billed revenue that has been processed in the selected time period. So if a bill was closed in that period, it will be included.
- Consumed: This filter will show all the consumed revenue that has been processed in the selected time period. So if an item was consumed in that period, it will be included. These could be items that are still on open bills.

### Group By
- Accounting Category: if your accountant has set up Accounting Categories, this filter will group the different services/products within their selected accounting categories.
- Bill: if you want to see a breakdown by customer/bill
- Service: this will breakdown the report by the services that have been posted, with the individual products as sub parts of each service.
- VAT Rate: if you would like to see the report filtered by the different VAT rates.

Most accounting systems are able to import the Accounting Report Excel Extract into their system, to help track and record revenue and open invoices. When you select "Export to Excel" accountants can easily see all the revenue according to the filters selected, make necessary corrections, and then import it directly into the accounting program used.
