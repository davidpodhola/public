title: Bills & Invoices
---

The Bills and Invoices Report is a chronological overview of all bills ordered by bill numbers (lowest to highest). This will help find a bill after departure, should you need to reprint or review it. If you have a bill number, at the top of the screen there is a search box, which helps identify bills quicker. Alternatively you can select a specific period during which the bill was closed to narrow down the search.

The top of the report shows the "Invoices".
When a bill is closed to "invoice" the issuer is able to set a payment date, so that you can track whether an invoice was settled or not. When it is overdue, it will get an orange-tag highlighting that payment is late.
If you would like to see the balances of all bills/invoices, select the "load values" at the top of the report, and it will add a column with all balances. You could then filter it down further, if you would like to see the unpaid balances of 1 specific travel agent or company.

## Options and Filter

This will load the value of the invoice, allowing you to quickly see the total amount of revenue outstanding on invoices.

### State

- Overdue Invoice
