title: Guests in House
---

The Guest In House Report displays all guests in house at the time of running the report. The report is ordered by room numbers, starting at the lowest number and going upwards. For each room the report displays all the registered guests in the room and the products that are included (such as breakfast, halfboard, etc.). You can print the report with just this basic information, which can be used in the breakfast room to check the guest names against the room numbers.

**Credit Check** In addition to the above-mentioned items, it also shows the level of preauthorization taken by the reception on this account and a credit column. The credit column takes the preauthorization and subtracts all the unsettled bill items. If there is a negative balance, the number gets highlighted in red, as it requires action by reception in order to gain more credit on the account.

To contact the guests (with regards to the credit) you will find an additional column with the e-mail addresses of the customers.
