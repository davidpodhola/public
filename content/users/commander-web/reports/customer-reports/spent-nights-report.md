title: Spent Nights Report
---

The Spent Nights Report is an overview of how many guests stayed at the hotel on a specific date. This may be important for statistical purposes. You will be able to filter the report also by different sub-reports, depending on your country. For example, if you are in Prague, you can filter by "Prague City Tax", and the report will only show "leisure guests" in the required age group so that the hotel can use this to settle the monthly city tax.
