title: Customer Statistics
---

The Customer Statistics Report is an extensive analysis of all of the guest profile data, allowing you to track and compare different groups of customers. This can be an extremely helpful tool for Social Media Managers, Marketing/Sales or PR to analyse customers and target markets.

The report can compare multiple sets of data, and can analyse them against each other. Below categories are the data points:

- Address
- Age
- Average Night Rate Per Person
- Business Segment
- Customer Category
- Gender
- Nationality
- Origin
- Rate
- Room Category

**Mode**
Numbers in the report can be displayed by "customers" or "nights"

**Display**
You can show numbers in physical numbers "counts" or as "percentages"

**Ordering**
You can either order the report alphabetically, or you can order it by to higher to the lowest value

## How to best use the report

- **Compare Channel Manager & Booking Engine numbers versus Country of Origin**. If you are seeing a lower number on the BE for a specific country versus the CM (relative), then maybe consider translating your website in that language. 
- **Male vs Female**: I see quite an imbalance in male vs female customer numbers. If you then compare it via its origin of business, it may give you a clue where this imbalance comes from. For example in 1 hotel I noticed that the website numbers were much more equal than the - OTA’s (where more males booked). So maybe its in the descriptions on the OTA’s?
- **Room Types vs Male/Female**: who is more likely to buy upgraded rooms?
- **Room Types vs Origin of business**: which source of business is booking your higher room categories?
- **Address vs Average Night Rate": this will help you understand which countries book the highest rates, and this helps you plan your pay-per-click campaigns to target these high value markets
