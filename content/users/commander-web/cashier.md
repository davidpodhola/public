The admin of a hotel can assign a “cashier” to individual persons or to multiple persons. Once a user has a cashier set up on his profile, a new icon will appear at the top of his/her screen. Through the Cashier they have access to complete cash transactions in the system. All cash transactions are tracked since the cashier was first opened (after a closed shift) in chronological order.

In Cashiering there are 2 options:

- **New Transaction**: This will allow for cash to be recorded that is used for petty cash transaction, such as parking, buying flowers for guests, etc.

- **Currency Exchange**: This option also allows for currency exchange, but only for hotels that actually offer this service. From this screen, you can input the amount of money and the guest’s name, and the system will calculate the converted amount and commission.

The cashier also tracks all Cash transactions made in the system on guest bills. THe cashier will keep a full overview of all cash income (money coming in) and outcome (money given out) and it will always give a snapshot of the current balance, which should correspond to the actual real-life balance of the cashier. At the end of the shift you would select "close cashier" and the system will ask you to which balance you would like to return the cashier. When you close the shift, the cashier will print a report that also highlights the amount of money in the "cash drop" that needs to be handed over to the manager.
