Before you start to work with the Mews Commander, the most important part is that you update your profile correct. If you do not do this before you start, you will find that the language or culture settings will prevent you from optimally using the system. 

## Your Profile

When you select the “Your Profile” icon at top of the screen, you will have several options.
Note: If you have created a guest profile in one or more of the hotels, your profile details will also show in this section, requesting more information.

### Personal Information

- **Language**: Here you can select the language in which you would like to display the system. Currently the system is translated in English, Czech and Dutch. Note that the default language of the system is English, so if anything is missing a translation in the system, it will show this item in English by default.
- **Culture**: You can select the culture in which you would like to see the system displayed. It will show dates and numbers in the selected culture. For example if you select Czech, it will display the days of the week in Czech and require numbers such as 6.5 (six and a half) to be written as 6,5 (comma instead of the decimal point)
- **Default Account**: If you have access to multiple accounts, you can select which hotel you would like to have as your default hotel. When you next log in to the system, it will open that specific hotel by default.

### Profile Picture

You can upload your profile photo into the Mews Commander, so that when you send messages through the system to other users, it will display your photo.

### Password

If you would like to change the password, select "Change Password," and the system will prompt you for your current password and the new password you would like to set. For security reasons, DO NOT ever share your password with anyone else, even if the person claims to work at Mews.

Should you have forgotten your password, visit http://www.mews.li and press the button "Forgot Password.” The system will prompt you to input your e-mail address and will resend your password.

Customers are sent login details via their confirmation e-mail. Once their profile is created in the system, their login details are sent to the e-mail address provided.
Should you have a customer asking to reset their password or stating that they did not receive their login details, you can visit http://www.mews.li and press the button "Forgot Password." The system will prompt you to input the guest e-mail address and will resend the password.

## Messages

Messages can be sent internally between employees. Besides employees, also guests who have downloaded the Navigator App, will be able to write the reception with requests directly. Messages come in both on the top-bar with a notification on the envelope icon, but also on the dashboard in the "messages" section.

Once you receive a message from a guest, all people who have "reception rights" will be notified. Once you open the messages section, you will see the unresolved message highlighted in blue (requiring action), once you have resolved the request, make sure you "resolve" the message by ticking the resolve-icon. Once resolved, the other employees will no longer see the message.

## Orders

Hotels who have the Mews Navigator installed, will be able to also load products for sale to the guests, which can be ordered directly from the smart-device of the customer. Order will come in as notifications on the top bad, and also in the section "orders" on the dashboard.

When you receive an order, they will appear in blue on the dashboard, to be resolved asap. To pick up the order, select the order, and check the details. From here you can:
1. process the order, which will post the item on the guest bill directly, and inform the guest that the order has been processed.
2. You can also comment on the order. Comments will be sent to the guest directly, so if you have specific questions about the order, this is the best way to ask the guest.
