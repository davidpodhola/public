## Arrival&Departure Dates

Select the reservations you wish to amend. Note that if you select multiple bookings with the same arrival and departure dates, the system will prefill the date fields with the correct dates. If you select bookings with different dates, it will not be able to prefill these fields.

If you are extending a booking with additional nights, there is no need to tick the box "Cancel without Fee" as this button is not applicable for extensions.

If you are shortening or extending a booking and do not tick the box "Keep Old Price," it will review if the prices have changed since you made the booking and re-price them.
When you shorten a booking, you need to decide whether you would like to charge cancellation fees. If you do, leave the box "Cancel without Fee" un-ticked.
