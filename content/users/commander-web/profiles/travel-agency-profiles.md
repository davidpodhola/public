To create the new travel agent profile, select the Profile icon and then select “Travel Agency Contracts.” This will take you to a list of travel agents who have been set up for your hotel. You can select any travel agent and update any additional details you may have such as IATA, contact person, address or notes with regards to the agency.

You can also create a new travel agent contract by selecting the button. Once this field opens, you will be asked to update the different details. One important field is the bill assignment field. If you manage this field correctly, when new bookings are made it will automatically assign the booking at the correct rate to the correct bill.

Note that most OTA (Online Travel Agents) already have profiles in Mews, and if you work with a Channel Manager, you need to select the profile from the listed TA profiles, rather than creating a new profile. The benefit of this is that the TA Profile is already mapped against all of the connected OTA's.

- **Customer Always**: When a new booking is created for this travel agent, it will leave the stay charge in the customer field, as the guest will be responsible for paying his bill himself.
- **Customer Always without Commission**: This option will discount the rate by the commission but still place the charge on the bill of the customer, who is due to pay for this charge.
- **Travel Agency Always**: This option will move the stay charge to the Travel Agent bill, so that the travel agent, rather than the customer, will have to pay for the rate.
- **Travel Agency Always without Commission**: This option will move the charge to the travel agent’s bill and will subtract the commission.
- **Travel Agency Only if Prepaid**: This option will move the bill to the travel agent only if it was pre-paid. If it was a BAR rate or another non-prepaid rate, it will leave the charge on the guest bill to be paid upon departure.
