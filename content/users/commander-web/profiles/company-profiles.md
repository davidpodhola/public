In order to book company rates, track company bookings and statistics, and allow for company invoicing, you need to create and attach a company profile to bookings.

To create a new company profile, in the top menu, select the Profile icon and then select “Companies.” This will take you to a list of existing companies. It will also allow you to select “New Company,” which will create a new profile requiring completion of details.

Should a company have multiple branches, you will need to create the head-office as a new company. In the profiles of the branch offices, you can easily assign the head-office as “Mother Company,” which tracks the full statistics of the company under 1 main profile.
