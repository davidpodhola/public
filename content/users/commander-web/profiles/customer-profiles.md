The customer profile is the personal profile of a guest within Mews. The profile is split up in the following 5 sub-sections:

- Dashboard
- Profile
- Internals
- Payments
- Billing

The unique identifier of a guest is the "e-mail address of the customer. If we recognize a new profile being created with the same e-mail address we will merge them automatically into the previous e-mail address. For this reason, be sure to update guest profiles only with the e-mail of the guest (never use the e-mail of a travel agent or secretary).
