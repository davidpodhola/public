Should your guests have specific comments that users of the system need to be aware of, you can customize different categories such as “VIP”, “Returning Customer” or “Previous Complaint.” You can also leave specific comments, which are then automatically linked to all future bookings of this guest. If you set up different profile categories, this will highlight the different profiles by underlining the profile name with a coloured line, giving the receptionist a subtle hint that he/she needs to review the profile comments. Should you require more categories, please contact your Mews representative. Should you have your POS connected to the PMS, then the button "Always Externally Chargeable" will enable payments to this account, even if you do not have a checked-in booking.

**Blacklisted** if you would like to blacklist a customer, then you can select this tickbox on the guest profile. It will prevent him/her from making a new booking either directly through the Mews Distributor or directly in the Mews Commander.

**Guest Profile Notes**: if you update the Guest Profile notes, these will print on the different reports (Reservations Report, Reservations Overview, Guest In House) ensuring all team members of the hotel see the comments of the guest each time they arrive.
