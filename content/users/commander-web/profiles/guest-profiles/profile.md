If you press the "Print" button on this screen, it will allow you to print a customer registration card for the customer with all his prefilled details completed. Additionally if you have multiple profiles of the same customer, you can select the other customer in the "Merge" search field. When you select “Merge,” it will show you both profiles. Select the profile with the most complete details, and it will merge the other profile into the one you selected. This ensures that you keep the system clean.

This tab also includes a great "merging" option, which allows you to merge 2 customer profiles into 1, if you have by accident created an duplicate. Type the name of the customer profile you are trying to merge, then click "merge" and it will show you both profiles, select the one you would like to keep, and it will merge the details of the other one into that profile.
