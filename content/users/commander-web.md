This is the full User Guide to the Web-App, the MEWS COMMANDER. 

The Mews Commander is a 100% Cloud based Hotel Management Platform developed and managed by Mews Systems s.r.o. based in the Czech Republic.

This guide will describe all the major functions, reports and settings of the Commander solution, and provide guidance for new and advanced users. As the system constantly evolved we try our best to keep all materials updated, but it may happen that a new function is introduced that is not described in the guide, or the functioning of that feature is different as described. In this case, kindly notify us at support@mewssystems.com and we will update the guide.
