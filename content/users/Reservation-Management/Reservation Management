## Creating Reservations

https://vimeo.com/130024143

In order to make a new reservation, click the “New Reservation” button at the top of the screen. This button is visible from anywhere in the system allowing for quick and instant reservations.

Pressing the button will open a calendar on top of the timeline.

**Step 1 - Dates**

- Select Arrival Date
- Select Departure Date. The moment you have selected the departure date, the calendar will close, but still display the selected dates at the top of the screen. If you would like to change the selected dates, simply click on the dates to reopen the calendar.

**Step 2 - Options**

- Origin: how did the booking come in, this will help the management of the hotel analyse the sources of business. If you do not select an origin, you cannot proceed to the next step. If you select "Company" or "Travel Agent" you will be asked which company to TA is linked to the booking, and those fields are obligatory in order to track the production per company.
- Segment: Next you are asked to select the Business Segement of the booking. This again helps management analyse the origin of business. Management of the hotel can set up custom business segmentation for their hotel in the configuration of the system.
- Products: lastly, you are asked to select the products that you would like to have included into the booking. These could be items that you sell together with the room such as Breakfast, Baby Cots, Welcome VIP setups, etc. When you hover over the item you can see the cost of each item.

**Step 3 - Pricing**

- If you are working at a hostel, there is a quick switch at the top of this screen that allows you to see "beds" or "rooms/dorms".
- The first column shows the room types you have at the hotel
- The second column shows how many rooms you have available in the selected stay period.
- Rooms: If you would like to book more than 1 room, you can amend the number in this selection next to the room type. This is a quick tool to book larger groups.
- Adults / Children: how many adults or children will you accommodate in the room. It only allows you to select up to the maximum number of people in a room, so the screen will tell you how many people fit in a room. It will not allow selections of more people.
- Rate Groups: the rates it displays next to the initial columns are according to the different rate groups. A rate group is a group of rates that have the same cancellation conditions, so we merge these together in 1 column and display the lowest available rate in that selection. This ensures you always offer the lowest available price to customers. When you hover over the currency name (ie. EUR) it will tell you which exact rate is behind the selection. If you would like to book a custom rate, you can simply override the rate provided in this screen and it will allow you to book the custom rate. Select the + sign to select a specific rate, and add it to your shopping basket

**Step 4 - Finish Booking**

- Select the customer by tying the last name, the first search result is always to create a new profile with a customer that has the same last name. Below the first search result we display all other options of customers in the system with the same name. Once a profile is selected, you can click on the word "customer" to open the guest profile and see his/her details and history.
- State: here you can select whether you would like to book a Definite booking (confirmed) or an Optional booking. If you select the "optional" state, you will be asked which release date you would like to offer on this booking. If the booking is not confirmed by the release date, it will appear on the dashboard in red as a booking that passed its option, and needs to be resolved.
- Confirmation: you can select whether you would like to "send" or "not send" a confirmation. If you would like to send it to a "custom e-mail" if someone else books for the guest (like for example a secretary booking for her boss), in that case it will send the confirmation directly to the secretary.
- Notes: if you have any specific booking notes, you can add them here and they will print on all reports.
- Create: when all selections are made, you can press the button "create" and it will complete the booking and take you straight to the completed booking.

##Booking Management

In order to manage an existing reservation, you need to find the booking first. There are a few methods to quickly find a booking:

- The quickest way is to type the guest name/e-mail/confirmation number/room number in the search box at the top menu. Once you select the customer, you will be redirected to the Customer Dashboard where you have an overview of all future bookings of this client. Please select “Manage Booking.”
- You can select a booking directly on the timeline. The booking details will appear from the right. Please select “Manage” to open the “Manage Booking” screen.
- From the reservation overview or reservation report, you can find a booking based on different filters. The bookings are selectable and once you open the booking, press “Manage Booking.”

The Booking Management screen consists of 2 sides, left and right. The right hand side contains the booking information. If you have a group booking you will see multiple names on the right, you can click on each name to open up the details about each booking. Next to each name you have an icon of a puppet, which will take you straight into the guest profile, and the second icon is a dollar sign, which will take you into the billing screen of the guest.

On the top bar you have several buttons:
- Lock All or Unlock All: this will lock all the bookings on the timeline, so that no one can move the bookings, unless they unlock them again.
- Select All or Deselect All: if you have multiple bookings in the reservation, you can quickly click this button to select or deselect all the bookings
- Open All: this will open up the booking details of each individual reservation in this group.
- Close All: this will close all the booking details of the individuals bookings

 <a name="Guide-State"></a>
###State
In the State screen you are able to manage the status of the reservation. The system knows the following statuses:

- **Optional**: The booking is not yet confirmed but is blocking space on the timeline and availability. No revenue, however, is yet recorded in revenue reports. If options are cancelled, no cancellation fees will be incurred. All optional bookings have a release date assigned, and on the date of release, it will highlight the bookings in the reservation overview/report to decide whether to extend the option or release. Note that the system will not automatically release bookings.
- **Confirmed**: Bookings that are confirmed will display on the timeline and have revenue assigned. If cancelled they may be liable for cancellation fees, depending on the rate type selected.
- **Cancelled**: If a booking is cancelled, it will be removed from the timeline, and cancellation conditions will decide whether it should incur charges. It will open the availability (via sales efforts) for that one room to be booked.
- **Checked-out**: All bookings that have completed their stay will have the status "Checked-Out". Once a booking is checked-out, you can no longer check it back in.
- **Checked-in**: A booking that is currently in-house will be considered "Checked-In"

From the **State** tab you will be able to manage the different statuses.

- **Customer Balance**: At the top of the State screen, you can see the customer balances of all customers assigned to the group and selected (by the tick box next to bookings). You can select "Payments" to add preauthorization or prepayments to the booking. Alternatively you can enter the "Billing" screen where you can take payments or settle bills. If the "billing" button is blue, that means that there is action required, as there are still open bills that require to be closed. So even if the balance is set to 0, and the button is blue, that means that the bill is not yet closed. If you are handling a group booking and have selected multiple bookings in the group, you will see the Customer Balance of all participants, allowing you to quickly see the balance of the whole group.
- **Room Assignment**: You will see all the bookings that are in the group and selected. Here you can quickly see the housekeeping status of the room currently assigned, and you can either assign another inspected room or inspect the room directly in the system (if you have the ok from your housekeeper). It only displays rooms in the same category, organized by room number, and it will not allow you to assign a room that has another "locked" reservation on it.
If the "Room Criteria" have been set up, you can instantly see the key features of the different rooms, next to the room number to help reception assign the correct room to the right customer.
https://vimeo.com/115251453
Similar to the Customer Balance if you have a group booking and you select multiple bookings you can do the room assignment for multiple rooms at the same time.
- **Confirm**: If a booking is on OPTIONAL state, you can confirm bookings directly from this screen. It will change the status to "Confirmed" and post the revenue on the customer bill. Next to the confirmation box you are also able to send a confirmation to another person who is not assigned to the booking. Type the e-mail in the box and he/she will receive the confirmation e-mail with a summary of all the bookings that are selected.
- **Check-in**: Once you have assigned an inspected room, you can select the button “Check-In.” Note that the check-in button will only appear if you have selected a booking(s) that is on arrival today. It will check in all bookings that were selected, allowing you to check-in multiple bookings at the same time. If a booking is due to arrive today, there is also a "print" button next to it, allowing you to instantly print the registration card of the guest, if your country still requires physical signatures on the registration cards.
- **Check-out**: On the day of departure for the booking(s) selected, a new button will appear called "Check-Out.” The system will only allow you to check-out a guest for whom all open bills and unsettled items have been paid with a balance on zero. Should you wish to check-out a customer with an open balance (as he may pay it later), select the "Check-Out with Open Bill" and fill in the reason. This room will then be transferred to the Guest Ledger report in red, where the payment will need to be resolved as soon as possible.
- **Cancellation**: If you wish to cancel a booking, you are asked to provide a reason from a selection of reasons. It is important to select the correct reason, so that management can analyse the reasons and see if there is a key reason for cancellation, to try and prevent this. You can also describe it in the open-text-field. See below a list of the cancellation reasons with a short description if needed:
 - BookedElsewhere: if the guest has booked another hotel or destination
 - CancelledByAgent: if the agent calls and does not provide a further reason
 - ConfirmationMissed: if the customer has an optional booking, but did not confirm on the release date
 - ForceMajeure: if the guest had to cancel his stay due to a force majeure event, such as earthquakes, floods, etc.
 - GuestComplaint: if the guest complains, and wants to cancel their order
 - InputError: if the booking was input by error
 - InvalidPayment: if the payment details provided by the guest were not valid
 - NoShow: if the guest did not show up for his accommodation
 - Other: If none of these reasons describe the reason, then specify it further in the open-text-field
 - PriceTooHigh: if the guest cancels his stay due to the high price
 - ServiceNotAvailable: if you are for example fully booked and you have to cancel the booking, this is because the "service is not available"

Secondly, you need to decide whether you would like to charge cancellation fees or not. The system knows the cancellation conditions on each rate type, and it will charge them accordingly, for example:

--> Fully Flexible / BAR: If you set a rate with a cancellation condition to allow cancellations up to 24 hours prior to arrival (24 hours prior to the official check-in time set in the system) and you cancel a booking within the 24 hours, it will automatically post the cancellation charge (at 0% VAT) and remove the stay charges.

--> You should only close bills on the day of check-out, because if you close a bill before check-out and try to shorten the reservation or cancel it, the system will attempt to correct the charges on the closed bill (as they were posted at the wrong VAT level). This may result in new charges (cancellation charges) being posted on the bill.

--> If you try to cancel a bill "Without Fee” but have already closed the bill, then the system will post refunds automatically on the bill.

###Properties

- **Arrival&Departure Dates**: Select the reservations you wish to amend. Note that if you select multiple bookings with the same arrival and departure dates, the system will prefill the date fields with the correct dates. If you select bookings with different dates, it will not be able to prefill these fields.
If you are extending a booking with additional nights, there is no need to tick the box "Cancel without Fee" as this button is not applicable for extensions.
If you are shortening or extending a booking and do not tick the box "Keep Old Price," it will review if the prices have changed since you made the booking and re-price them.
When you shorten a booking, you need to decide whether you would like to charge cancellation fees. If you do, leave the box "Cancel without Fee" un-ticked.
- **Business Segment**: You can select whether the Business Segment of the booking. The hotel can set up different business segments themselves in the configuration (under the rates section in "services").
- **Origin**: Select the source of business.
 - AgencyDirect: For travel agent bookings
 - CompanyDirect: For company bookings
 - E-mail: Direct booking via e-mail to the hotel
 - Fax
 - InPerson: If a person comes to the reception and makes a future booking.
 - PhoneCall
 - WalkIn: If a person comes to the reception and makes a booking for the same night.
 - Website: Booking through the website.
- **Room Category**: If you would like to change the booked room category to a higher or lower category in the system, you can select the new room category here. When you make this change, you need to decide whether you would like to keep the old price or whether you would like the system to re-price it against the pricing set in the system (for those specific dates and the new room type).
- **Person Count**: If the occupancy of the room has changed, you can select here the new number of people occupying the room. If you tick the box "Keep Old Price," it will keep the base price the same. Please note that the only thing the system will add or subtract is the cost of the per-person-per-night items within the booking (such as breakfast cost).
- **Company**: If you wish to add an existing company to a booking, this will allow you to track the company production in reports. It also opens up the possibility in billing to open a bill to the company name/address.
- **Travel Agent**: If you wish to add an existing travel agent to the booking, this will allow you to track the travel agent production in reports. It also opens up the possibility in the billing to open a bill to the travel agent/address.
- **Notes**: If you wish to add or update the notes on a bill, select the bookings for which you wish to update the names and the current note will appear for you to amend. (Please note that if you select multiple bookings and the existing notes are different, it will not be able to display any notes. The “Notes” box will be empty.)

<a name="Guide-Group"></a>
###Group

- **Group Name**: Assign a group name to the booking, enabling you to quickly (through the search box) find all bookings related to the group name. Each booking is automatically assigned a group name which is constructed from the arrival date and the guest name. Note that group names should not contain spaces, allowing you to search for groups via the search box.
- **Merge Group into this one**: If you wish to add reservations to an existing group, you can use this option.
 - Step 1: Make the additional bookings manually.
 - Step 2: Assign the new booking(s) the same group name.
 - Step 3: Merge the groups.
- **Add an existing customer**: If you would like to manage the customers staying in the physical room, you can assign a customer with an existing customer profile. Type his name to find the profile and add it to the booking.
- **Add a new customer**: If the customer you are trying to add to the booking does not have an existing profile in the system, you can quickly generate a new profile. The only required detail is the last name of the customer.
Once you have added a customer to the booking, in the booking details you will see a list of all customers assigned to the booking. You have to always ensure that 1 customer is made the owner of the booking because this will ensure that there is 1 main person displayed on the timeline and in the arrivals report. For example, if a room is booked for 2 persons, and you are trying to assign a 3rd person to this room, the system will not allow it. You have to press the "<" arrow to move 1 person out of the booking into the list of "Unassigned Companions.”

Note that all persons assigned to the group (even if they are in the "unassigned companions" section) will be connected, and if you enter the bill of one of the group members, you will be able to see all items on the group bill for all companions of the group.
To remove a member from a group, press the "X" next to their name, and they will be removed from the group and group-billing details.

<a name="Guide-Pricing"></a>
###Pricing

- **Rate**: When you select this box, it will offer you all available rate types in the system, and you can change the rate type (which will impact the cancellation conditions on the booking). It will also automatically recalculate the value of the booking based on the new rate type assigned. If you wish to keep the same rate, tick the box "Keep Old Rate"
- **Set Average Night Cost**: If you wish to amend the average night rate, type the new value and select the currency. All rate changes require a reason to be completed in order to notify management of the change.
- **Percentual Discount**: To give a percentual discount, type the discount percentage and complete the reason for the discount.
- **Per Night Pricing**: First select the currency of the rate. Secondly for each night of the accommodation you can set a custom price that you have negotiated. In the last box, provide a reason for the reprice. Note that you cannot set a price that is negative. If you set the price to a value below the value of the products, it will set the value of the products (such as breakfast, etc) to 0.

<a name="Guide-Items"></a>
###Items

In this tab you will see a list of all the items that have been ordered by or for the guest related to the booking. First you will see the accommodation nights. Secondly you will see a list of product orders (such as breakfast, parking, etc.). You can select each posted product to see more details about the creator, time of creation, etc. If the product has not yet been consumed, you will still be able to cancel the item from the bill.

- **Nights**: You can quickly see each accommodation night and its value. But more importantly you can see on whose bill the accommodation was posted, so when you move the accommodation to someone elses bill, this is a quick way to find out where it was moved to.
- **Additional Expenses**: When the booking is cancelled and you post cancellation fees, you can quickly see that in this overview
- **Product Orders**: an overview of all the products that are linked to the accommodation part of the booking (such as city tax, breakfast, etc). If you are handling a future stay, you are able to quickly cancel products from the booking, by pressing "cancel".
- **Add Product**: if you made a booking and you forgot to include a product (such as city tax/breakast) you can quickly select the product and add it. Note that when you add a product, it will increase the total price of the accommodation.
- **Deposit**: this is a feature that is specifically for hotels that operate in a country where tax is paid when money is received, not when revenue is consumed (for example Czech Republic). This feature allows for a correct taxaction of the revenue. For example:
1. A non-refundable booking is made for next month
2. You take payment today (as its non-refundable), which means you should pay VAT also today. However as teh revenue is only posted next month, we have built a 3rd step.
3. You select the deposit option, which allows you to post a deposit (revenue correction). You can select the amount you would like to post, and the currency and VAT. Once posted, the system posts 1 revevenue item called "deposit" which should be closed against the payment you received today, allowing you to close the bill of these 2 items. The system will also post a second "deposit" item (with a consumption date, one month from today) which will balance out the future accommodation revenue and set the bill balance to 0, this bill should be closed on the day of departure.

<a name="Guide-Mailing"></a>
###Mailing

To send a confirmation by e-mail, you have 2 options

1. If the customer has an e-mail address on his personal profile, then simply press "OK," and the system will resend the confirmation e-mail to the customer.
2. If the customer asked to have the confirmation sent to another person, then in the "Custom E-mail" field you can complete the information of the customer to whom you wish the send the confirmation and press "OK."

<a name="Action Log"></a>
###Action Log

The event log is an overview of all changes made to a booking since its creation. It provides details about the person, time, date and specific change.
