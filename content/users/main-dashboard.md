##Dashboard

The dashboard is the home screen of the Mews Commander. It always gives an instant, quick, up-to-date overview of your hotel. Clicking on the Mews icon in the top left corner (of any screen in the system) directs you back to the dashboard screen, so the dashboard is never more than 1 click away.

The Sections of the Dashboard:

- **Housekeeping**: An instant view of how many rooms have been cleaned and still need to be cleaned today. This allows you to quickly review performance and any possible delays.
- **Front Office**: These 2 pie charts show how many check-ins/outs have been completed or are still to be completed within today.
- **Rooms**: This pie chart gives a breakdown of the housekeeping status of the different rooms in order to check the performance of housekeeping. You can quickly identify how many rooms have been cleaned and still require cleaning.
- **Occupancy**: What the occupancy is for the upcoming week, and which are the busy arrival/departure days.
- **Guest Satisfaction**: You always receive your most up-to-date ranking on TripAdvisor to ensure that everyone in the hotel is aware of the latest reviews and to ensure that guest happiness is at the forefront of everything they do. Mews will allow you to create a competitive set of up to 6 hotels against which you can measure your performance. To set this up, kindly inform your Mews representative.
- **Social Media**: You can instantly see your Facebook performance in terms of likes. Also, your Klout Score allows you to see how well your posts across the different social media platforms are performing with customers. Mews will allow you to create a competitive set of up to 6 hotels against which you can measure your performance. To set this up, kindly inform your Mews representative.
- **Guest Ledger** / **Open bills**: You get a snapshot view of the total unpaid balances that are outstanding from guest bills. This ensures constant and consistent follow-up and closing of guest bills. When you open this report, it will highlight in red the profiles with outstanding charges but not with a future reservation. These outstanding accounts should be reviewed carefully to ensure timely payment.
- **Profile Completion**: In order to ensure quality data input, you can immediately see how well your front office is updating guest profiles of the bookings that are in-house and arriving today. The bar chart easily shows the percentage of completion.
- **Reports**: From the dashboard you can access a variety of different reports. Clicking on the individual sections of the above-mentioned departments will direct you into a much more detailed report that breaks down the results for analysis.
- **Orders**: If you have the Mews Navigator installed at your hotel, then you will be able to review customer orders directly from this tab.
- **Messages**: If you have received any messages through the Mews Navigator, these will display in the Messages section. You can see if you have any unread or unresolved messages. Its important to always resolve messages as soon as possible, as it affects customer service if you do not.

###Support

On the top of the screen you will find the question mark icon. When you click on the icon, you will find 3 options:

1. Contact Support: You can select this option if you need support. The system will ask you to give us a subject and description of the problem. It is always best to send us a screenshot of what you see on your screen. Try to give as much detail as possible, so that we can trace the occurrence on the backend. Try to share which booking or report with which filters, etc.
2. Guide: Well done! You found it. The Guide is the document you are currently reading.

###Multi-property Environment

If you are the Manager for multiple hotels, all using Mews Systems, you will be able to have all your hotels combined under 1 login for all your employees.

When the Admin of the hotel is creating profiles for the different users, you will need to create a user in each hotel. When you create a user in 2 or more hotels with the exact same e-mail address, the system will recognize this, and add the icon of a building on the top of the screen. When you select the building, it will give you an option to select all connected hotels, and you can instantly switch between properties.

###Your Profile

When you select the “Your Profile” icon at top of the screen, you will have several options.
Note: If you have created a guest profile in one or more of the hotels, your profile details will also show in this section, requesting more information.

**Personal Information**

- **Language**: Here you can select the language in which you would like to display the system. Currently the system is translated in English, Czech and Dutch. Note that the default language of the system is English, so if anything is missing a translation in the system, it will show this item in English by default.
- **Culture**: You can select the culture in which you would like to see the system displayed. It will show dates and numbers in the selected culture. For example if you select Czech, it will display the days of the week in Czech and require numbers such as 6.5 (six and a half) to be written as 6,5 (comma instead of the decimal point)
- **Default Account**: If you have access to multiple accounts, you can select which hotel you would like to have as your default hotel. When you next log in to the system, it will open that specific hotel by default.

**Profile Picture**

You can upload your profile photo into the Mews Commander, so that when you send messages through the system to other users, it will display your photo.

**Password**

If you would like to change the password, select "Change Password," and the system will prompt you for your current password and the new password you would like to set. For security reasons, DO NOT ever share your password with anyone else, even if the person claims to work at Mews.

Should you have forgotten your password, visit http://www.mews.li and press the button "Forgot Password.” The system will prompt you to input your e-mail address and will resend your password.

Customers are sent login details via their confirmation e-mail. Once their profile is created in the system, their login details are sent to the e-mail address provided.
Should you have a customer asking to reset their password or stating that they did not receive their login details, you can visit http://www.mews.li and press the button "Forgot Password." The system will prompt you to input the guest e-mail address and will resend the password.
